## Resume
Purpose: obtain a interview( instead of a job)
Assumption: Only 10 secs to make an impression. make it inviting to read.

#### TODOS
- step 1: robot reads resume and looks for keywords, skills.
  so don't put tables, graphs -> because ATS can't read them.
- font: 10~12pt, 3/4 ~ 1 inch margin
- 1-level bullet points. no sub-bullets.
- use `BOLD CAPS` for headings
- use `BOLD` or `CAPS` to guide reader's eye
- `Italics`, `underlining` for papers, publications.
- No first person words(I, my). Use phrases that begin with an active verb.

#### Resume Structure
1. name & contact
2. summary & objective
  - seeking XXXX in ABC field, with emphasis in XYZ.
  - maybe put skills in summary section
3. education
  - bold the degree.
  - put gpa if strong
  - may add `relevant course work:`
4. experience
- `active verb` convey skills, `nouns` conveys skills
- no `resposible for ...`, just use `...`
- accomplishment, not tasks. ex: `designed webapp` -> `designed webapp **adopted by org**`
- demonstrate skills used.
- no jargons, abbreviation.
- use keywords: so you have to know the language of industry.

## Networking

Not about braggin/being aggressive/salesy. communicate your value that could help the other person. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8cfh6WdHn0)

step1: who's in your network?

know about what skills are needed to be in the desired field/job

type of contact
- direct: already friends
- indirect: friends of friends
- relelvnt: people in same domain, ex. alumni

example reach out msg
```
it was a pleasure to meet you at <event>, I enjoyed out conversation.
<...> I'd like to stay in touch.
```
<there are more message templates shown in the slides.>

- email version: not directly asking for referral. ask for advice. people like to give advice.
- ask something like asking their work progress, their experience, give an insight of the job ...etc. not directly asking for something obviously beneficial only for me.
- job responsibilities / typical day life / what skills will help in the job / ...

tell me about yourself: first quiestion/ most common question in networking.

- establish 1st impression
- set the tone
- position yourself.

Answering tell me about yourself question: you are `leading the conversation`
